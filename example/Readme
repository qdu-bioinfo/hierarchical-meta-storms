#Here we provide a demo dataset with species abundance of
#30 synthetic metagenomic samples in 3 different Groups.
#
#File description
#dataset1.sp.abd: relative abundance of species.
#dataset1.meta: group information of the samples.
#
#To run the demo, you can either
#
#sh Readme
#
#or
#type the following command
#
#Commands to calculate the distances of microbiome functional profiles
MS-comp-func -T dataset1.ko.abd -o dataset1.dist
#Commands to implement PCoA
MS-get-pc -d dataset1.dist -o dataset1.pcoa.pc
#Output description
#
#dataset1.dist: Pairwise distance of the 30 samples
#dataset1.pcoa.pc: Coordinates results of PCoA (Principle Co-ordinate Analysis) based on the distance matrix
#
#This demo run should take less than 1 minute on a recommended computer.
